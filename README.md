# CAN Bus Emulator

Hi, This is a simple CAN Bus emulator which is part of my home made HIL system. It is based on a STM8 microcontroller. This design is published under MIT license. So feel free to customize and use it in any open source or commercial projects. 
# Frimware
At this time, I'm developing the firmware. It will be freely accessible under MIT license. But, Don‚Äôt wait for me, develop your customized firmware and share it with others. üòâ
